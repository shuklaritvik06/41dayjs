### Function Statement aka Function Declaration

```js
function a(){
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

### Function Expression


```js
var b = function (){
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

Major difference between the function statement and function expression is Hoisting, how it is stored in the global memory.

### Anonymous Functions

```js
var b = function (){
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
Function statement with no name is called anonymous func.

### Named Func Expression


```js
var b = function a(){
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
### First class functions

Ability to use functions as values is first class function. Can be returned from a func, passed as params etc.

### First class citizens

Same as first class functions, an ability to be used as values makes first class functions as the first class citizens in js.
